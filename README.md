# tesseract-ocr-enhanced
Repo for our SIV Project

## Installation
We used Python 3.12.0 and Tesseract-OCR 5.3.3. See requirements.txt for the required packages.

## Src
The src folder contains the source code for our project.
There are different functionalities:
- `manual_trackbar.py`: manually adjust the parameters (automatic trackbar will not be implemented)
- `automatic_filtering.ipynb`: automatic filtering of the text through a specific pipeline

At the moment, .ipynb files are used for testing purposes. They will be removed in the future.
